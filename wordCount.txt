You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the [project web page](http://spark.apache.org/documentation.html)
and [project wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SPARK).
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Testing first requires [building Spark](#building-spark). Once Spark is built, tests
can be run using:
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
["Specifying the Hadoop Version"](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html#specifying-the-hadoop-version)
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.
Please refer to the [Configuration Guide](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html)
in the online documentation for an overview on how to configure Spark.
